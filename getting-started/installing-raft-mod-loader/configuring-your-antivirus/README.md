# Configuring your antivirus

## **Why is my antivirus suspecting RMLLauncher to be a Trojan/Malware?**

{% hint style="success" %}
**RMLLauncher is completely safe to use.**\
_It's important to note that both RMLLauncher and Core are open-sourced, allowing users to analyze the code._
{% endhint %}

Our launcher behavior might seem unusual to antivirus programs because it involves downloading files, loading code into the game and connects to servers.\
We also do not possess a yearly Microsoft code signing license, which can trigger alerts.

Since our software is open-sourced, If it were a virus, someone would have noticed by now.\
Rest assured, our community has thoroughly examined the software. So, you can trust RMLLauncher without any concerns. ðŸ˜Š

## 1. Adding exclusions in your antivirus

To prevent false positives for the launcher, add these two exclusions to your antivirus settings:

1. **RMLLauncher.exe**
2. **C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Roaming\RaftModLoader**

Select your Antivirus from the list below to get a detailed guide:

{% content-ref url="windows-defender.md" %}
[windows-defender.md](windows-defender.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="malwarebytes.md" %}
[malwarebytes.md](malwarebytes.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="avast.md" %}
[avast.md](avast.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="norton.md" %}
[norton.md](norton.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="bitdefender.md" %}
[bitdefender.md](bitdefender.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}



Your antivirus is not on the list? Search on google **"how to add exclusions in \[Your antivirus name...]"** and there should be a support website from that antivirus explaining how to do it.&#x20;



## 2. You should be done !

**Simply restart our launcher and it should be working !**
