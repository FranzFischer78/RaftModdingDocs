# Norton

1. To add the exceptions in Norton you can follow the tutorial [here](https://support.norton.com/sp/en/us/home/current/solutions/v3672136).
2. If Raft Mod Loader can't connect to the internet, you'll need to add an exception to your firewall too:
   1. Open **My Norton**
   2. Go to **Settings** -> **Firewall** -> **Application Control**
   3. Use the search function to find **`HML`**
   4. Allow network access for **`HML`**
