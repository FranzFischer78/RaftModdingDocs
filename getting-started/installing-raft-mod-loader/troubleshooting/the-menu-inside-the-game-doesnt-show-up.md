# The menu inside the game doesn't show up

## The menu inside the game does not show up <a href="#menu-not-showing-up" id="menu-not-showing-up"></a>

This is a fairly common issue so don't worry. Please do the following steps:

#### 1. Open the launcher

Close Raft if it is still running and open the launcher application as **administrator**.

#### 2. Open the settings

Click on Settings:gear:icon to open the Launcher settings.

#### 3. Change the starting method

In the settings, you need to enable **`Start Game From Steam`**:

#### **4. Start the game**

Now, close the Settings and press `Play` to start the game.

#### 5. Did it work?

If this worked, you should now see the modding menu inside the game. If you can not see the menu as shown below, try excluding the mod loader from your antivirus:

{% content-ref url="../configuring-your-antivirus/" %}
[configuring-your-antivirus](../configuring-your-antivirus/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
