# There's an error counter...

In the following, we will **verify the files' integrity**. This is a Steam tool that allows checks and repairs broken game files.

1. Open Steam and open the _Library_ tab.
2. Right-click _Raft_ and select _Properties_ in the pop-up-menu.
3. In the menu, select the _Local files_ tab.
4. Click on the _Verify integrity of game files_ button.
5. If the tool finds any broken files, it will automatically repair them.
6. Once done, you can close the windows.
7. Now, try to open the Launcher again.
8. Does it work now? If the error keeps coming up, this might be related to your Antivirus program.
