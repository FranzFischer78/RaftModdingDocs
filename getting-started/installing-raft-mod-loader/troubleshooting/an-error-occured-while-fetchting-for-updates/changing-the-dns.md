# Changing the DNS

1\. Let's check if that's the issue first. **Open your command prompt** by **typing CMD** in the Cortana search bar for example and **select "Run as administrator"**:\

2\. **Run the following commands**: `nslookup raftmodding.com` and `nslookup raftmodding.com 8.8.8.8`\

If the ip adresses are different that means that there's an issue with the DNS and it might be blocking the Raftmodding requests.\

3\. We will **change the DNS** to one that is not blacklisting our website like the Google DNS. Here's a guide on how to setup the Google DNS on your system: [https://www.whatismyip.com/google-dns/](https://www.whatismyip.com/google-dns/)\

4\. Once you're done setting up the DNS make sure to **restart the computer** and try again running the Mod Launcher. You might also need to **change the DNS on your router**. The steps will be very dependent on your router.&#x20;
