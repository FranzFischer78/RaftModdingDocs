There are multiple reasons this issue can be happening. The first and most likely one is your antivirus interfering. Follow the linked guide and see if it helps:

{% content-ref url="../../configuring-your-antivirus/" %}
[configuring-your-antivirus](../../configuring-your-antivirus/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

If that doesn't help, don't worry we got you :wink:

{% content-ref url="disabling-ipv6.md" %}
[disabling-ipv6.md](disabling-ipv6.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

If that didn't help too try changing the DNS

{% content-ref url="changing-the-dns.md" %}
[changing-the-dns.md](changing-the-dns.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
