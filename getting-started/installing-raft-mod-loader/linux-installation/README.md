# Linux or Steam Deck installation

There are two main ways we've found to run the Raft Mod Loader on Linux and the Steam Deck:

* [Using Bottles](using-bottles.md)
* [Using just Wine](using-wine.md)

Both guides should work but we strongly recommend you to use Bottles as it's just more user friendly, more compatible between distributions and it especially works well on the Steam Deck!
